The internet has the following :-
1 - gloabal transit ISP, access ISP's
2 - multiple global transit ISP's and  access ISP's 
3- Tier architecture was built with regional ISP's and then Tier - 1- ISP's 
4 - Now POP's points of presence for all the ISP's and then Internate exchange points for peering (without paying for this customer -provider ISP type stuff was now made) - multi homing ISP's were also allowed( connecting to 2 tier -1's etc)
5 - Content provider networks, tap in and directly connect to low tier ISP's 
(eg : google , they also talk to tier - 1 but they control their expense)
