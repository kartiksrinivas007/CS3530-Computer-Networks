Delays ( on the node ) not packetization delays of any sort,
The time for the packet to completely arrive onto the node and the time to examine and change the header of this packet is called - proc delay

after reading it and understanding its IP, the routing protocol, sends it into a queue - where it faces queueing delay.

Post the queueing it is started transferrring the entire packet onto the link of the transmission link this is called transmission delay 

The time now for it to reach the next router is called propagation delay ( in WAN its order o fmicros to milli seconds) 

for N- 1 routers the tolal time taken for end to end transmission can be seen as 		T_tot = N(d_proc + d_trans + d_prop) (for uncongested network)

throughpput = min (R_i) in an ideal network, however, most of the time the acess ISP is the one which causes the small amount of throughput.
