What is the internet ?
The two most common packet switches are called routers and link-layer switches
the estimated amount of data transmissions per second may be ~40 Exabytes per second

exa ~ 10^18
Access at the home :-
THe DSLAM is located at the telephone company's CO. DSLAM converts the analog signals in the tel wire back to digital signals.

the telco downstream is ISP, speeds ~ 50 kHz to 1mHz and the upstream is slightly slower ~4kHz -> 50kHz and the last frequency band ois 0 -> 4kHz is for telephone communication.


you can also do a cable internet access, CMTS plays the same role as DSLAM and does the digita to analog
Here there is no FDM , and there are 2 channels only , upstream and downstream
the Speeds are ~ 40 - 50 Mbps and the. ( Also if all of them do it together there may be a problem since every packet goes all the way back and forth)

there is a collission issue due to this common use of upstream and downstream and this is resolved by MAP( Multiple access protocol)

Verizon really into optical networks and wants to use them heavily, there are 2 main architectures that are involved the PON and the AON ( active and passivve) passoive is switched ethernet

The OLT that is prsesnt after the optical splitter is similar to the cable head end, all the packets are transmitted to all ONT's. (optical network transmitters)
