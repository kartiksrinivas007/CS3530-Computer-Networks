The socket is a sogtware interface between the process and the network.
Process - Socket, House - Door analogy.
The network layer onwards is the Potman.
The socket is also widley called the <b>Application Programming Interface</b>
The user barely ha sany control over how the transport layer side of the socket is  going to be used, he only controls the type of the protocol on the other side and the maximum buffer and segment sizes.

The application side of the socket is completely programmable however.
The common port numbers for applications are 80 for HTTP and 25 for SMTP.

RDT(Reliable data transfer is apostman which will not fail)
URDT(Unreliable data transfer is a postman which may fail!)

Internet Telephony is P2P. Eg: Skype.

elastic applications make use of what is there , eg : mail applications and

Applications that are sensitive to bandwidtht change are called bandwidth-sensitive applications.


The other services that can be provided are Throughput guarantees and timing gaurantees ( timing required for gaming and Skype )
and security

Timing and throughput guarantees do not exist in reality, we only designed SKype to cope up with timing loss and so on.
